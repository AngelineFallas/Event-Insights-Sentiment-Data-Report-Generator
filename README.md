# üìä EventInsights: Sentiment-Based Feedback Analyzer (Prototype)

This project is a **prototype** designed to analyze textual feedback using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and generate a structured Excel report. It groups comments by sentiment and user type (Volunteer or Donator), helping organizations understand motivations, positive highlights, and areas for improvement.

## üì• Data Collection  
The data for this analysis was collected using **Google Forms**, and the responses were exported as a **CSV file**. This allowed for easy processing and analysis in Python using standard data science libraries.

## üõÜ Requirements & Installation

Before running the script, install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn openpyxl textblob nltk
```

You also need to download the `vader_lexicon` for TextBlob's sentiment analysis to work correctly:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
```

## üß† Why These Libraries?

* **Pandas**: Efficient data manipulation and Excel exportation.
* **TextBlob + NLTK**: Lightweight NLP tools suitable for basic sentiment classification.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For generating clear and professional visualizations.
* **OpenPyXL**: To manage multi-sheet Excel reports with formatting.

These were chosen for their simplicity and ease of integration in a lightweight prototype. More advanced models (e.g., from Hugging Face) may be used for production-grade implementations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. The script reads a `.csv` file with user feedback including fields like role (Volunteer/Donator), age, and comment.
2. It performs sentiment analysis using TextBlob and classifies each comment as *Positive*, *Neutral*, or *Negative*.
3. It generates an Excel file with the following sheets:

   * **Execution Log**: Contains timestamp, number of comments processed, and runtime duration.
   * **Analysis Summary**: A combined overview, including total feedback and role distribution.
   * **Volunteers Report**: Insights specific to volunteers.
   * **Donators Report**: Insights specific to donators.

Each detailed report includes:

* Bar plots of age distribution.
* Comment counts per sentiment.
* Extracted summaries: *Motivations*, *Highlights*, and *Suggestions for Improvement*.

The Excel filename is auto-generated as:
`EventInsights_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.xlsx`

## üìù Output Files in This Repository

* `FeelingAnalizer.py`: Main Python script.
* `volunteering_data(2).csv`: Sample dataset used in this analysis.
* `EventInsights_2025-04-03_19-36-52.xlsx`: Final generated report from the sample data.

## üíº Application Potential

Although developed for a volunteer-donator feedback context, this prototype can be adapted to **customer service** or **product review analysis**. To do so:

* Replace the `volunteering_data(2).csv` with your own feedback dataset.
* Adjust role filters in the code:
  (Change `"Volunteer"`/`"Donator"` labels as needed.)
* Optionally customize the summary sections and visualizations for your context.

## üöÄ Future Improvements (if scaled)

* Use multilingual or transformer-based NLP models (e.g., BERT).
* Integrate with a front-end or dashboard for dynamic interaction.
* Automate email report delivery or real-time monitoring.
